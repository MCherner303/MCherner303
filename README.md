ðŸ‘‹ Hello, world! I'm Morgan, a finance professional turned aspiring AI Engineer from the beautiful city of Santa Barbara, California. While my past career revolved around the dynamic world of finance, Iâ€™ve set my sights on an exciting new pathâ€”exploring the vast potential of artificial intelligence.

Currently, I'm focused on applying my knowledge of Python, the foundational language for many AI and machine learning applications, and actively transitioning from study to building a portfolio that demonstrates my skills in technology, finance, and creative problem-solving. My goal is to leverage this portfolio to launch a career where I can blend these diverse skills to create impactful solutions.

Beyond my focus on AI, I have a few interesting side stories. For instance, Iâ€™m the proud owner of a White Belly Caique parrot named Kermit, whom I adopted and rescued. If you're curious about Kermit's adventures, feel free to ask!

I'm also passionate about visual arts and creative expression. In the past, I even ran a streetwear line that featured my original artworkâ€”another chapter in my story that reflects my love for blending creativity with technical skill.

What I'm Currently Working On:
ðŸ”­ I'm actively building a portfolio of AI and data analytics projects, while honing my expertise in Python and SQL. Iâ€™m seeking opportunities to apply my tech, finance, and creative skills in real-world scenarios.
ðŸŒ± I'm continuously learning the latest trends in machine learning and AI, with a focus on creating practical projects that demonstrate my readiness for a career in the field.
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source AI projects and data analysis initiatives, particularly those with intersections between technology, finance, and creative problem-solving.
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m seeking guidance and feedback on enhancing my GitHub portfolio to showcase my strengths and attract potential employers.
Whether you're interested in Python, AI, machine learning, or even want to swap stories about parrots or creative endeavors, I'm here to connect, collaborate, and grow. Letâ€™s embark on this exciting journey together and make impactful contributions to the world of AI and beyond!
